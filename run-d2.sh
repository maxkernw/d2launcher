# (re)Launcher script to repeatedly try to launch DiabloII, until it loads.
# Sometimes it takes upwards of 10 launches, but this script *does* work (for me)
#
# IMPORTANT: Put the location of the Diablo II.app on the next line, in quotes
#            because the spaces will cause havoc.  I installed DiabloII onto
#            a second partition that I formatted as HFS after reading all the
#            horror stories at https://us.battle.net/forums/en/bnet/topic/20758758996
#
# Installation instructions:
# 1) save all this to a file like 'run-d2.sh' in your home directory
#
# 2) update the line below that says D2=...etc... with location of where you
#    have installed DiabloII on your Mac.  (HINT: it better be a HFS location!)
#
# 3) make that file executable (chmod +x ~/run-d2.sh)
#
# 4) execute that file from a Terminal window to watch the fun
#
# NO SUPPORT PROVIDED FOR THIS SCRIPT, Use at your own risk, yada yada yada...
# released to public domain
